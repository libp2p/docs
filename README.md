## Overview

libp2p is a modular framework that encapsulates an evolving set of specifications for peer-to-peer networking. What started as the networking component that enables IPFS turned into a general-purpose framework to deliver a modular, peer-to-peer networking stack of protocols that are transport agnostic, flexible, reusable, and easy to upgrade.

libp2p enables interoperability between applications, resilient applications, and advanced networking features like decentralized publish-subscribe or advanced data structures like distributed hash tables.

## Contributing content

The documentation site contains several different kinds of content. We’d love ❤️ your help with any of it:

1. **Introductory overviews**: If you spot a problem or have improvements, please post an issue or PR.

2. **Concept guides**: Concept guides are intended to present a brief overview of libp2p-related concepts.
   They strive to answer:

    - **What** is this?
    - How does it **relate** to the rest of libp2p?
    - How can (or should?) you **use** it? (This can often vary by implementation
    - **Where** do you go to learn more?
    - What is the **current state** of affairs?

    See a list of concepts we need help with by [checking the issues](https://github.com/libp2p/docs/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acontent+concept).

3. **Guides**: Most examples currently live in other repositories, like [js-libp2p examples](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/tree/master/examples). If you have thoughts on integrating them better, please file an issue. If you have feedback on individual examples or want to add a new one, please file an issue or pull request on the relevant repository. If you have ideas for guides or tutorials, they belong here! Please propose them in an issue here before creating a pull request.

4. **Reference material**: The navbar includes all the reference material available for libp2p. Please see the issues in this repository for current activity around reference/API documentation.

5. **Community**: If there are missing community links, feel free to file an issue or pull request,

This repository is also a website; we could use your help with design and technical features (interactive examples, better syntax highlighting, scripts to pull in content from other repositories, etc.) in addition to writing. To get a sense of what we could use help on, check the [issues](https://github.com/libp2p/docs/issues). If you decide to work on one, please post to the issue to let us know!

Before posting a pull request with your changes, please check [our style guide](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/DOCS_STYLEGUIDE.md) and [contributing guide](https://github.com/libp2p/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md).

Finally, let’s work together to keep this a respectful and friendly space. Please make sure to follow our [official code of conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

To run the libp2p documentation site locally, you must have
[NPM installed](https://www.npmjs.com/).
If you already have NPM installed, make sure you are running the latest version:

```shell
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

Follow these steps to run a copy of this site on your local machine.

1. Clone this repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/libp2p/docs
    ```

2. Navigate into the new folder and download the dependencies by running:

    ```shell
    cd docs
    npm install
    ```

3. Build the project and serve the static files to Hugo with:

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

4. Start the local Hugo's development server with:

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

5. Visit [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to view the site.
6. Press `CTRL` + `c` in the terminal to stop the local server.

## Configuration guide

### Static site generator

The libp2p documentation site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator,
making it easy to serve and host the static files on IPFS. In particular, the site uses
the [Hugo Doks theme](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) to present the libp2p documentation.

### Automated deployments

When opening a pull request, CI scripts will run against your feature branch to test your changes.

The CI/CD production workflow builds on the `master` branch and deploys the documentation site on [fleek](https://fleek.co/). It reflects the latest commit on `master` and publishes at [https://docs.libp2p.io](https://docs.libp2p.io).

### Translation

Please stay tuned for the steps to translate the documentation.
