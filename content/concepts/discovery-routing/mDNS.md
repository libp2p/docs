## What is mDNS?

mDNS, or multicast Domain Name System, is a way for nodes to use the multicast
system of DNS records [RFC 6762](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6762) over a
local network to discover and communicate with nodes. Nodes broadcast topics
they're interested in. The discovery, however, is limited to the peers in the
local network. mDNS is commonly used on home networks to allow devices such as
computers, printers, and smart TVs to find each other and connect. It uses a
protocol called multicast to broadcast messages on the network, allowing devices
to discover each other and exchange information.

## mDNS in libp2p

In libp2p, mDNS is used for peer discovery, allowing peers to find and
communicate with each other on the same local network without any configuration.
The basic mDNS node discovery flow begins when a peer starts or detects a
network change and then sends a query message to all peers. The node adds the
response it receives from other peers into a local database.

definitions, specific fields, and peer discovery, [visit the mDNS libp2p
specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/discovery/mdns.md).
