title: Transport

When you make a connection from your computer to a machine on the internet,
chances are pretty good you're sending your bits and bytes using TCP/IP, the
wildly successful combination of the Internet Protocol, which handles addressing
and delivery of data packets, and the Transmission Control Protocol, which
ensures that the data that gets sent over the wire is received completely and in
the right order.

Because TCP/IP is so ubiquitous and well-supported, it's often the default
choice for networked applications. In some cases, TCP adds too much overhead,
so applications might use [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol),
a much simpler protocol with no guarantees about reliability or ordering.

While TCP and UDP (together with IP) are the most common protocols in use today,
they are by no means the only options. Alternatives exist at lower levels
(e.g. sending raw ethernet packets or bluetooth frames), and higher levels
(e.g. QUIC, which is layered over UDP).

In libp2p, we call these foundational protocols that move bits around
**transports**, and one of libp2p's core requirements is to be
*transport agnostic*. This means that the decision of what transport protocol
to use is up to the developer, and in fact one application can support many
different transports at the same time.

## Listening and Dialing
Transports are defined in terms of two core operations, **listening** and
**dialing**.

Listening means that you can accept incoming connections from other peers,
using whatever facility is provided by the
transport implementation. For example, a TCP transport on a unix platform could
use the `bind` and `listen` system calls to have the operating system route
traffic on a given TCP port to the application.

Dialing is the process of opening an outgoing connection to a listening peer.
Like listening, the specifics are determined by the implementation, but every
transport in a libp2p implementation will share the same programmatic interface.

## Addresses

Before you can dial up a peer and open a connection, you need to know how to
reach them. Because each transport will likely require its own address scheme,
libp2p uses a convention called a "multiaddress" or `multiaddr` to encode
many different addressing schemes.

The [addressing doc](/concepts/addressing/) goes into more detail, but an overview of
how multiaddresses work is helpful for understanding the dial and listen
interfaces.

Here's an example of a multiaddr for a TCP/IP transport:

```
/ip4/7.7.7.7/tcp/6543
```

This is equivalent to the more familiar `7.7.7.7:6542` construction, but it
has the advantage of being explicit about the protocols that are being
described. With the multiaddr, you can see at a glance that the `7.7.7.7`
address belongs to the IPv4 protocol, and the `6543` belongs to TCP.

For more complex examples, see [Addressing](/concepts/addressing/).

Both dial and listen deal with multiaddresses. When listening, you give the
transport the address you'd like to listen on, and when dialing you provide the
address to dial to.

When dialing a remote peer, the multiaddress should include the
[PeerId](/concepts/peer-id/) of the peer you're trying to reach.
This lets libp2p establish a [secure communication channel](/concepts/secure-comms/)
and prevents impersonation.

An example multiaddress that includes a `PeerId`:

```
/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4321/p2p/QmcEPrat8ShnCph8WjkREzt5CPXF2RwhYxYBALDcLC1iV6
```

The `/p2p/QmcEPrat8ShnCph8WjkREzt5CPXF2RwhYxYBALDcLC1iV6` component uniquely
identifies the remote peer using the hash of its public key.
For more, see [Peer Identity](/concepts/peer-id/).

When [peer routing](/concepts/peer-routing/) is enabled, you can dial peers
using just their PeerId, without needing to know their transport addresses
before hand.

## Supporting multiple transports

libp2p applications often need to support multiple transports at once. For
example, you might want your services to be usable from long-running daemon
processes via TCP, while also accepting websocket connections from peers running
in a web browser.

The libp2p component responsible for managing the transports is called the
[switch][definition_switch], which also coordinates
[protocol negotiation](/concepts/protocols/#protocol-negotiation),
[stream multiplexing](/concepts/stream-multiplexing),
[establishing secure communication](/concepts/secure-comms/) and other forms of
"connection upgrading".

The switch provides a single "entry point" for dialing and listening, and frees
up your application code from having to worry about the specific transports
and other pieces of the "connection stack" that are used under the hood.

The term "swarm" was previously used to refer to what is now called the "switch",
and some places in the codebase still use the "swarm" terminology.
