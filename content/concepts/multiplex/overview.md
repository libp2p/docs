## Overview

Stream Multiplexing (_stream muxing_) is a way of sending multiple streams of data over one
communication link. It combines multiple signals into one unified signal so it can be transported
'over the wires', then it is demulitiplexed (_demuxed_) so it can be output and used by separate
applications. This is done to share a single TCP connection using unique port numbers to distinguish
streams, between the multiple proceeses (such as kademlia and gossipsub) used by applications (such as IPFS)
to make connection and transmission more efficient.

With muxing, libp2p applications may have many separate streams of communication between peers, as well as
have multiple concurrent streams open at the same time with a peer. Stream multiplexing allows us to initialize
and use the same [transport](../../transports/overview) connection across the lifetime of our interaction with a
peer. With muxing, we also only need to deal with [NAT traversal](../../nat/overview) once to be able to open as
many streams as we need, since they will all share the same underlying transport connection. Applications can enable
support for multiple multiplexers, which will allow you to fall back to a widely-supported multiplexer if a preferred
choice is not supported by a remote peer.

libp2p's multiplexing happens at the application layer, meaning it's not provided by the
operating system's network stack. However, developers writing libp2p applications rarely need to
interact with stream multiplexers directly, except during initial configuration to control which
modules are enabled.
