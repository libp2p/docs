### Chapter 4

# Reference Documentation

This section contains in-depth reference material, including a [glossary](/reference/glossary/) with definitions of libp2p terminology.

### Specifications & Planning

While libp2p has several implementations, it is fundamentally a set of protocols for 
peer identity, discover, routing, transport and more.

See the [specifications section](/reference/specs/) for details.

### Implementations

At the core of libp2p is a set of [specifications](/reference/specs/), which together 
form the definition for what libp2p is in the abstract and what makes a "correct" libp2p 
implementation. Today, implementations of libp2p exist in several languages, with varying degrees 
of completeness. The most complete implementations are in [Go](/reference/go/), 
[JavaScript](/reference/js/), and [Rust](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p).

In addition to the implementations above, the libp2p community is actively working on 
implementations in [python](https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p) and [the JVM via Kotlin](https://github.com/web3j/libp2p). Please check the project pages for each implementation to see its status and current 
state of completeness.
