Get in touch with other members of the libp2p community who are building tools and applications with libp2p! You can ask questions, discuss new ideas, or get support for problems at [libp2p discussion forums](https://discuss.libp2p.io/), but you can also [hop on IRC](/community/irc/) for a quick chat.

See the other links in the community section for more information about meetings, events, apps people are building, and more.
